1. What is new about the relationship between the <header> and <h1> tags in HTML5?
    As HTML5 was all about better semantics and arrangements of the tags and elements, the <header> tag specifies the header section of the webpage. Unlike in previous version there was one <h1> element for the entire webpage, now this is the header for one section such as <article> or <section>. According to the HTML5 specification, each <header> element must at least have one <h1> tag.


2Inline elements just take up the space that is absolutely necessary for the content and does not start from a new line.
Example:- <span>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <button>, <em>, <select>, <abbr>, <label>, <sub>, <cite>, <abbr>, <script>, <label>, <i>, <input>, <output>, <q>, etc.


Block elements start on a new line and consume the full width of the page available.
Example:- <div>, <p>, <header>, <footer>, <h1>...<h6>, <form>, <table>, <canvas>, <video>, <blockquote>, <pre>, <ul>, <ol>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <hr>, <article>, <section>, etc.

    3. What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?
        The <figure> tag specifies the self-contained content, like diagrams, images, code snippets, etc. <figure> tag is used to semantically organize the contents of an image like image, image caption, etc., whereas the <img> tag is used to embed the picture in the HTML5 document.

            5. Is the <datalist> tag and <select> tag same?
                No. The <datalist> tag and <select> tag are different. In the case of <select> tag a user will have to choose from a list of options, whereas <datalist> when used along with the <input> tag provides a suggestion that the user selects one of the options given or can enter some entirely different value.


                    7. What are Semantic Elements?
Semantic elements are those which describe the particular meaning to the browser and the developer. Elements like <form>, <table>, <article>, <figure>, etc., are semantic elements.
